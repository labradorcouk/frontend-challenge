# Frontend Challenge

### Instructions
At Verv we offer a utility switching service. For this service we require users
to input their current gas and electricity tariffs, and provide them with the
functionality to change their tariffs.

The task is to build single page app which:

1. Displays a user's gas & electricity tariffs and payment methods
2. Allows the user to select a different gas & electricity tariff

You are provided with a mock backend server which has two routes.

The backend can be run via:
```
npm install
npm start
```

Once that is running, two endpoints can be visited at:
```
http://localhost:3000/user
http://localhost:3000/tariffs
```

Using these backend routes, create a dashboard with everything you feel is
required (dropdown, select, options etc.) to allow users to view & change their
tariffs.

Display any data you think is relevant.

A button to 'submit' the new changes should be somewhere on the page, but
instead of calling a backend api it can simply `console.log` the results.


### Evaluation

You are expected to use a modern front-end framework. React is preferred but
AngularJS and similar frameworks are acceptable.

The task will be evaluated largely on the solution to the problem rather than
styling. So you do not need to spend excessive time on this and basic styling
will suffice. However, if you wish to use packages such as `styled-components`
or others to improve the look then feel free.
